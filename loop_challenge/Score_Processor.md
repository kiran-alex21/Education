# Score Processor

## Main Task
A client would like a system that can take in the scores that students
get on a test, and produce a list of information about those scores.
They are happy for the system to be run from the command line for the moment.

They would like to know:
- How many scores were entered
- The average score
- The highest score
- How many people got the highest score

Trial list: 52,16,7,26,72,35,5,56,34,72

## Extension 1

The client would like to include the first name of each student
alongside their score, and would also like to know the:
- Top 5 scores
- Top 5 score holder names

Trial List: Liam, 28; Olive, 15; Noah, 22; Emma, 19; Olli, 11; Lottie, 25; Eli, 8; Amy, 29; James, 4; Sophia, 17

## Extension 2

The client now wants the program to run with a GUI rather than in the command line.
Create a list of requirements for the GUI
Make a basic starter file (like the ones in this task)
Use Tkinter to build your GUI
